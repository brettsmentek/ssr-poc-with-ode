# Server side rendering POC

# WIP

## About

This repo is an opinionated SSR setup to optimize around a few key points:

- [x] Supports Styled Components out of the box

- [x] React Loadable and dynamic imports are used to create chunks specific for each page

- [x] React Router is used for hot-reloading using react-hot-loader

- [x] Use react-router-config to use a Routes file to define pages

- [x] Server build compiles a server bundle for NodeJS

- [x] Server bundle is used to generate static HTML, hot reloads, and is served on port 3000

- [x] Static server parses stats generated by the Webpack build and React Loadable to inject file paths for JS / CSS, and the correct chunked module file paths into the page

- [ ] In production mode the server bundle is used to iterate over all routes and create a page of HTML for each route which it writes to /dist

- [ ] Support CSS Modules
